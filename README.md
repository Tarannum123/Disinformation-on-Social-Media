# Disinformation on Social Media

This repository contains the materials for the project *'Did they really tweet that? Detecting misattribution disinformation in screenshots of social media posts'*, funded by the US Department of Education. The details of the funding can be found [here](https://www.odu.edu/article/vmasc-awarded-115-million-us-department-of-education-for-graduate-research). The aim of the project is to detect whether an image of a screenshot is fake or real by utilizing the live web and web archives. The outcomes of this research will help to reduce the spread of disinformation by making it easier to determine the veracity of screenshots of alleged tweets. 

As for the initial stage of the project, the dataset for the shared screenshot images on Twitter are being collected. The details of the collected dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/Tarannum123/Disinformation_Social_Media/tree/main/Dataset).
